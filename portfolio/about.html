    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi! My name is Maksim Arezina, and I’m a Media Production major at High Point University with a passion for storytelling through visual media. I’m driven by the power of film, editing, and creative content to inspire, inform, and connect people. Whether I’m producing short films, editing promotional videos, or crafting digital stories, my goal is always to create work that leaves an impact.

Throughout my time at High Point University, I’ve developed hands-on experience in video editing, audio production, and media writing, building a strong foundation in both the technical and creative aspects of production. My coursework in Audio Production (MPE 2221) and Writing for Media Production (MPE 2231) has deepened my understanding of how story, sound, and visuals work together to engage audiences.

I’ve also gained real-world experience as a Video, Film, and Media Production Intern with the National STEM Honor Society, where I collaborated with a team of interns to create weekly video content using Adobe Premiere Pro, stock footage, and branded graphics. That experience taught me the importance of communication, time management, and creative collaboration—skills I continue to bring into every project I work on.

As I continue to grow as a media creator, I’m most interested in pursuing a career as a video editor, producer, or director, where I can merge creativity with technical expertise to bring powerful stories to life.

When I’m not behind the camera or in the editing suite, you’ll probably find me exploring new film techniques, brainstorming concepts, or drawing inspiration from the world around me.</p>
